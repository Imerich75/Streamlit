📊 Cyber Risk Forecast Dashboard (2025–2030)
Interactive visual analytics app predicting future cyber attack risk across countries from 2025 to 2030, using enriched global datasets and machine learning.

Built with Streamlit, powered by open data and Random Forest models.


🚀 Live Demo
👉 Launch the app on Streamlit Community Cloud

🔍 Key Features
📈 Forecast Visualization: Projected attack counts by country from 2025 to 2030

🌍 Global Choropleth Mapping with log-scaled visual cues

📊 Vanilla BI module: Simple bar/pie charts for non-technical audiences

🧠 AI-powered predictions: Based on Random Forest regression trained on historical exposure, GDP, internet metrics, and population data

📁 Fully modular architecture for fast updates and future expansion

🧠 Methodology
Data Merge from multiple sources: cyber incidents, GDP, internet usage, population, etc.

Feature Engineering with custom exposure indexes and threat scores

Random Forest Regression model trained on pre-2025 data

Linear Extrapolation of features into 2025–2030

Prediction Output saved into future_predictions.csv

Dashboard Visuals rendered directly from static outputs – fast and safe
